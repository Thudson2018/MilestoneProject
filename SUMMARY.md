# 📊 Website Files Summary

## What Was Wrong With Your Website

Your GitHub repository had a critical structural issue:

### The Problem:
1. **HTML code was embedded inside README.md** instead of being in separate HTML files
2. **No actual website files existed** - only a README with HTML code in it
3. **All navigation links pointed to non-existent files** (index.html, topic1.html, topic2.html, references.html)
4. **No CSS stylesheet** to style the pages
5. **No images** for the website

### Why This Was a Problem:
- GitHub Pages and web browsers cannot display HTML code that's inside a README.md file
- The README.md is meant for project documentation, not the actual website
- Without separate HTML files, the website cannot function
- Without CSS, the website would have no styling even if the HTML files existed
